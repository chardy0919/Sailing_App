Project Idea: Sailing Trip Planner

Description:
Develop a Sailing Trip Planner that assists sailing enthusiasts in planning and organizing their sailing adventures. Users can log in, plan sailing routes, check weather conditions, connect with other sailors, and integrate with third-party APIs for real-time navigation and marine weather updates.

Key Features:

User Authentication:

Users can register, log in, and log out.
Authentication ensures that users can save and manage their sailing plans.
Sailing Route Planning (CRUD):

Users can plan sailing routes, specifying waypoints, destinations, and estimated durations.
Each route may include information about potential anchorages, points of interest, and recommended stops.
Weather Integration (API):

Integrate with a marine weather API (e.g., Windy API or NOAA Weather API) to provide real-time weather updates, wind conditions, and wave forecasts for the planned sailing routes.

Navigation Assistance:

Implement a real-time navigation feature using nautical charts and GPS data to help users stay on course during their sailing trips.

Community and Events:

Allow users to connect with other sailors, share their planned trips, and join sailing events organized by the community.
Marine Points of Interest (API Integration):

Integrate with maritime databases or APIs to provide information about marinas, fuel stations, and other points of interest along the sailing route.
Proper Back-end Models and Database Design:

Design Django models for users, sailing routes, weather data, and community events, ensuring proper relationships and data storage.
Styling, Presentation, and Site Navigation:

Implement a responsive and visually appealing React front-end.
Use a CSS framework or styling libraries to create a maritime-themed design.
Ensure easy navigation for users to plan routes, check weather, and connect with the sailing community.
Feature-Rich Application:

Provide a logbook feature for users to record their sailing experiences and share them with the community.
Implement a notification system for weather alerts or community event updates.
Web Design Principles:

Follow web design best practices for a clean and intuitive user interface.
Ensure accessibility and responsiveness for a seamless user experience on different devices.
Tech Stack:

Front-end: React
Back-end: Django
Database: PostgreSQL
Authentication: Django REST Framework (JWT)
This project allows sailing enthusiasts to enhance their sailing experiences by efficiently planning trips, staying informed about weather conditions, and connecting with a community of like-minded individuals.

1: get fixture data from chatgpt for models
2: create model to save port destinations(lat,lng)
2: put api requests in backend and chain them from port to weather request
